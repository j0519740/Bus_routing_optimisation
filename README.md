# Bus Routing Optimisation in Punggol
An efficient network of public transport is helpful to improve the quality of public transport services and
save time for travelers. One of the important aspects of urban transportation is the continuous
optimization of the bus network.
In this project, we aim to find the solutions that minimize the total number of buses required to serve all the bus stops in Singapore's Punggol area. The problem is modelled around the well-known multiple travelling salesman problem (mTSP) which is a Mixed Integer Problem (MIP) and utilizes Gurobi Optimizer and other libraries to solve this problem.
